# Orange tree. 

# Make an OrangeTree class that has a height method that returns its height and a 
# one_year_passes method that, when called, ages the tree one year. Each year the 
# tree grows taller (how- ever much you think an orange tree should grow in a year), 
# and after some number of years (again, your call) the tree should die. For the first 
# few years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while it should, and I guess 
# that older trees produce more each year than younger trees...whatever you think 
# makes the most sense. And, of course, you should be able to count_the_oranges (which 
# returns the number of oranges on the tree) and pick_an_orange (which reduces the 
# @orange_count by 1 and returns a string telling you how delicious the orange was, or 
# else it just tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this year). Make sure 
# any oranges you donâ€™t pick one year fall off before the next year.
